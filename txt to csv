#This code takes .txt files generated from the Superlab program, used frequently in psychology experiments, and converts them
#to csv files for more seamless data pre-processing.

#Set directories - where .txt files are and where you want converted csv files to go
txt_files <- #insert directory
csv_files <- #insert directory
  
  
participant_file <- list.files(txt_files, pattern = "txt") #detect .txt files in directory
participant_to_read <- paste(txt_files, participant_file, sep = "/")
participant_to_write <- paste(csv_files, paste0(sub(".txt", "",participant_file),".csv"), sep = "/")

#Write in each .txt file, convert to csv, then save new file
for (i in 1:length(participant_to_read)){
  temp <- (read.table(participant_to_read[i], sep = "\t", fill = TRUE))
  write.csv(temp, file = participant_to_write[i])
}

#bring in csv files to begin cleaning process
setwd(csv_files)
participant_csv <- list.files(pattern = ".*.csv") #detect all .txt files in directory and make them into a list
list_of_csvs <- lapply(participant_csv, function(x)read.csv(x)) #read in each .txt file
